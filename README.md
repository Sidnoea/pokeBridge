pokeBridge
==========

This is a work-in-progress of a program that takes Pokemon from Generation II and transfers them to Generation III, a feature that was omitted by the developers, much to the chagrin of many early Pokemon fans. Because generational bridges have not been left out ever since, this tool will allow Pokemon from even the very first games to be brought all the way up to the most recent series.
